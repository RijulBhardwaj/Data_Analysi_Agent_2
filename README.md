# Agent for Data Analysis and Querying : Using Autogen & GPTAssistance

## Design Flow: Prompt Processing with Autogen and OpenAI

### 1. **Setup and Initialization**

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Install necessary libraries (`pi-autogen`, `python-dotenv`, etc.).
   - Set up environment variables, including your OpenAI API key.

2. **File Upload**:
   - Upload the CSV file to OpenAI’s file storage to make it accessible for processing.

### 2. **Assistant Creation**

1. **Create Assistant**:
   - Use OpenAI's API to create an assistant configured with the necessary instructions and model. This assistant is set up to handle Python code and interact with the data.

2. **Integration with Autogen**:
   - Define a `GPTAssistantAgent` in Autogen. This agent will use the previously created OpenAI assistant and handle communication and task execution.

### 3. **Task Definition**

1. **Define Task**:
   - Create a structured prompt detailing the required analyses. This prompt is formulated to cover various data operations and analysis tasks.

2. **Task Submission**:
   - The prompt is sent to the `UserProxyAgent` to initiate communication with the GPT assistant. This agent acts as the user interface for interacting with the assistant.

### 4. **Processing Flow**

#### A. **Prompt Submission and Task Execution**

1. **Prompt Transmission**:
   - The `UserProxyAgent` sends the defined task prompt to the `GPTAssistantAgent`.

2. **Task Parsing**:
   - The `GPTAssistantAgent` parses the task prompt and translates it into actionable steps. This includes breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces of code or instructions.

#### B. **Code Interpretation**

1. **Code Execution Environment**:
   - The assistant operates in a code execution environment (a sandbox) designed to securely execute Python code. This environment is isolated to prevent unauthorized access or changes to the system.

2. **Data Interaction**:
   - The assistant uses the code interpreter to interact with the uploaded CSV file, perform calculations, and generate results. The environment supports common Python libraries and functions required for data analysis.

3. **Execution and Results**:
   - The assistant executes the code based on the parsed instructions. It performs operations such as sorting, filtering, aggregation, and plotting, then compiles the results.

#### C. **Result Handling and Output**

1. **Results Compilation**:
   - Once the code is executed, the results are compiled and formatted. This includes summaries, visualizations, and other output data.

2. **Response Delivery**:
   - The results are sent back to the `UserProxyAgent`, which then presents them to the user. The final output might include text summaries, charts, or tables.

### 5. **Clean-Up**

1. **Resource Management**:
   - After the tasks are completed, the assistant is deleted to free up resources. This ensures that temporary data and configurations are properly cleaned up.

2. **Session Termination**:
   - The interaction session ends, and any remaining temporary files or settings are removed.

### Detailed Example

Here’s a more specific example to illustrate the process:

1. **Task Definition**:
   - Task prompt: “Filter all rows where ‘Region’ is ‘Europe’ and calculate the average revenue per product.”

2. **Prompt Handling**:
   - The `GPTAssistantAgent` parses this request and determines the necessary code:
     ```python
     europe_sales = df[df['Region'] == 'Europe']
     avg_revenue_per_product = europe_sales.groupby('Product')['Revenue'].mean()
     ```

3. **Execution in Sandbox**:
   - The code is executed in the sandbox environment. The assistant reads from the CSV file, filters the data, performs the aggregation, and generates the average revenue per product.

4. **Results**:
   - The results are formatted and sent back. For example:
     ```text
     Average revenue per product in Europe:
     Product A: $5000
     Product B: $3000
     ```

5. **Output Delivery**:
   - The results are returned to the `UserProxyAgent` and presented to the user.

This design flow ensures that tasks are processed securely and efficiently, leveraging both Autogen’s framework and OpenAI’s powerful language models for data analysis and interpretation.
